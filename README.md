Code Java and databases
For java we see the three files reading, writing and citta. In the Writing.java file, on the other hand, 
all you do is have the user enter through the stream with which you can then create the Città.dat file to memorize the cities,
the provinces and the numbers of inhabitants entered by the user, and each time the user wants to insert a new city 
the previous ones will not be deleted. In the citta.java file we see that a constructor is executed where the information 
is actually saved, in the last file read.j was the file containing the main () method and then the class the main one will 
be the one that,
by deducing its values from the citta.java class, 
we will read the cities, provinces and number of inhabitants inserted.

While as far as the relication of a database I have done in this way,
creating an index.html file where two buttons are displayed one for inserting the other
to delete data inside the databases. For example, we press on insertion verra visualized a web page 
where we can insert a student in the school database by supplying all the necessary data, the data transfer 
between the html form and the data slaavtaggio in the database start through the php and sql language in the 
page insert.php in fact we can see the php language integration with sql in fact we see the first line which is 
include "connection.php" (the file connection.php is the one thanks to which we connect to the school database)
subsequently we see the variables where inside each go a value of each field of the html form is saved, then we 
write the line of code to insert the values ​​inside the database and save it inside a variable if everything went 
to good end we see on screen the written student correctly inserted. The file database.php is used for the creation 
ùof the database that will happen only once as the creation of the student table that is in the file table.php
